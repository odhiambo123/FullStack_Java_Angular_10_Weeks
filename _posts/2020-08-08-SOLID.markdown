### L - Liskov Substitution principle
- Introduced by Barbara Liskov in a 1988
- Derived class must be substitute of the base class or parent class.
- when should a class B inherit from class A?
    - If you want object of B to be used wherever an object of A is used
    - if you want to use an object of A in making of the object of B then use delegation

### I - Interface segregation principle
- Do not force any  client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them.  
### D - Dependency Inversion Principle
- High level modules and low level modules should not directly depend on one another but on abstraction
- This ensures loosely coupled entities so they can be modified independent of each other.
