## MySQL

### Start the server:
```sql
"C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin\mysqld"
```
### Stopping the server:

```"C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin\mysqladmin" -u root shutdown```

[Customizing path:](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-installation-windows-path.html)


```sql
mysql -u root -p
```
- you can change root to any `user`
- then enter password

### To reset password:
```sql
`ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<strong password>';`

```
### Create a new user:
```sql
mysql> `create user 'amc' identified by '<strong password>';`
```

### Restrict access:
```sql
mysql> `create user 'amc'@'localhost' identified by '<strong password>';`
```
### Show all databases:
```sql
`SHOW DATABASES;`
```

``` SHOW SCHEMAS ```

### Choose the database to work on
```sql
`use databasename;`
```

### Create the database

```sql
mysql> `create database myCoolDB;`
```

### Grant all access to the user amc2:
```sql
mysql> `grant all on myCoolDB.* to 'amc2';`
```


# MySQL Constraint
- These contraint in MySQL is used to specified the rules or restrict what value / data will be store in the table
- They provide a suitable method to ensure data accuracy and integrity inside the table

# Type of containts
1. Column level constraint - are applied only to the single column that limit the type of particular column data
2. Table level constraint - are applied to the entire table that limit the type of data for the whole table


# NOT NULL
# Check
# Default
# Primary Key
# AUTO_INCREMENT
# Unique
# Enum


# NOT NULL

```sql

create table employee (id integer Primary key, firstname char(50) NOT NULL,lastname char(50) NOT NULL, email char(50) NOT NULL);

```

`describe employee;`



`insert into employee (id, name) values (1, 'mark');`

# Check
mysql> `create table employee (id integer, name char(50), age integer CHECK(age >= 18));`

mysql> `describe employee;`


mysql> `insert into employee (id, name, age) values (1, 'Mark', 21);`

mysql> `insert into employee (id, name, age) values (2, 'paul', 15);`

# Default
mysql> `create table employee (id integer, name char(50), country char(50) DEFAULT 'USA');`

mysql> `describe employee;`


mysql> `insert into employee (id, name, country) values (1, 'Mark', 'UK');`

mysql> `insert into employee (id, name) values (2, 'John');`

mysql> `select * from employee;`



# Primary key
You can have only one primary key per table and this we make the column value not null and unique

mysql> `create table employee (id integer primary key, name char(50));`


mysql> `describe employee;`


mysql> `insert into employee values (1, 'maek');`


mysql> `insert into employee values (1, 'maek');`

mysql> `insert into employee values (2, 'maek');`


mysql> `select * from employee;`



# AUTO_INCREMENT
```sql
mysql> create table employee (id integer primary key AUTO_INCREMENT, name char(50));

```

```sql
`describe employee;`
```



mysql> `insert into employee (name) values ('Mark');`


mysql> `insert into employee (name) values ('smith');`


mysql> `insert into employee (name) values ('john');`


mysql> `select * from employee;`



### Unique

mysql> `create table employee (id integer, name char(50), email char(50) UNIQUE);`


mysql> `describe employee;`


mysql> `insert into employee values (1, 'mark', 'm@gmail.com');`


mysql> `insert into employee values (1, 'mark', 'm@gmail.com');` - will now throw an error for duplicate entry

mysql> `insert into employee values (1, 'mark', 'm2@gmail.com');`


mysql> `select * from employee;`



### Enum
mysql> `create table employee (id integer, gender ENUM('male', 'female'));`


mysql> `describe employee;`

mysql> `insert into employee values (1, 'male');`

mysql> `insert into employee values (2, 'female');`

mysql> `insert into employee values (3, 'f');`
mysql> `insert into employee values (3, 'Female');`

mysql> `select * from employee;`

### Advance queries / Mysql Clauses
- where
- distinct
- from
- order by
- group by
- having


### MySQL where clause
The `where` clause is used to write condition

- where - the single condition
> `select * from employee where id  =1;`

- AND  - both side condition should be true
> `select * from employee where id = 1 and name = '';`

- OR - either of the condition is true
> `select * from employee where id = 1 or name = '';`


mysql> `create table users (id integer, email char(50), password char(50));`


mysql> `insert into users values (1, 'test1', '123');`


mysql> `insert into users values (2, 'test2', '123');`


mysql> `insert into users values (3, 'test3', '987');`


mysql> `select * from users;`


mysql> `select * from users where id = 1;`

mysql> `select * from users where id = 2;`

mysql> `select * from users where email = 'test1' and password = '123';`

```sql
mysql> select * from users where email = 'test1' and password = '987';

```


```sql
mysql> select * from users where email = 'test1' or password = '987';
```

### Distinct
Is used to remove duplicate records from the table and fetch only unique records

> `select DISTINCT id from table`

mysql> `create table employee (id integer, name char(50));`


mysql> `insert into employee values (1, 'Wetangula');`


mysql> `insert into employee values (2, 'Wetangula');`


mysql> `insert into employee values (3, 'Ruto');`


mysql> `insert into employee values (4, 'Karua');`


mysql> `insert into employee values (4, 'Watsonm');`

see the table created
mysql> `select * from employee;`

use of distinct
mysql> `select DISTINCT name from employee;`


# Order By
Is used to sort the records in ascending or descending order:

- `select * from employee order by col_name DESC`
- `select * from employee order by col_name ASC`

mysql> `create table employee (id integer, name char(50), email char(50));`


mysql> `insert into employee values (4, 'a', 'a@gmail.com');`

mysql> `insert into employee values (1, 'b', 'b@gmail.com');`

mysql> `insert into employee values (5, 'c', 'c@gmail.com');`

mysql> `insert into employee values (2, 'd', 'd@gmail.com');`

mysql> `insert into employee values (3, 'e', 'e@gmail.com');`

mysql> `select * from employee;`


mysql> `select * from employee order by id ;`


mysql> `select * from employee order by id ASC;`


mysql> `select * from employee order by id DESC;`


mysql> `select * from employee order by name DESC;`


# Group by
- Used to collect data from multiple records and group the result by one or more column
    - Mostly use with select
    - You can also use an aggregation function like `count, max, min, sum etc`

```select expression1, expression2 from table by expression```

mysql> `create table employee (id integer, name char(50), salary int, age int, job char(50));`

mysql> `drop table employee;`    


mysql> `create table employee (id integer primary key AUTO_INCREMENT, name char(50), salary int, age int, job char(50));`


mysql> `insert into employee (name, salary, age, job) values ('mark', 5000, 20, 'admin');`


mysql> `insert into employee (name, salary, age, job) values ('paul', 4000, 26, 'clerk');`


mysql> `insert into employee (name, salary, age, job) values ('watson', 8000, 30, 'admin');`


mysql> `insert into employee (name, salary, age, job) values ('john', 18000, 50, 'manager');`


mysql> `insert into employee (name, salary, age, job) values ('stacy', 12000, 33, 'clerk');`


mysql> `insert into employee (name, salary, age, job) values ('rangel', 22000, 30, 'manager');`


mysql> `select * from employee;`


mysql> `select job from employee group by job;`


mysql> `select job, count(job) from employee group by job;`


mysql> `select job, sum(salary) from employee group by job;`


mysql> `select job, sum(salary), min(salary), max(salary), avg(salary) from employee group by job;`


mysql> `select job, sum(salary) total, min(salary) minSalary, max(salary) maxSalary, avg(salary) AvgSalary from employee group by job;`



# having
- Used with group by clause
- Returns the row where condition is true;

mysql> `select * from employee;`


mysql> `select age, job, sum(salary) from employee group by job having age > 25;`



# MySQL Key
1. Unique Key
2. Primary Key
3. Foreign Key
4. Composite Key



# Unique Key
- Is a single field that ensures all values to be stored in the column are unique
- Column will not have duplicate values

- You can have more than one column with unique constraints in a table and it can accept null

Rules
------
1. It is useful when we want a column that cannot have identical values
2. It store only distinct value that maintains the integrity and reliability of the database
3. It can contain a null value but only once

### Syntax
-----

`create table employee (id integer, name char(50), email char(50) UNIQUE);`
`create table employee (id integer, name char(50) UNIQUE, email char(50) UNIQUE);`
`create table employee (id integer, name char(50), email char(50), UNIQUE KEY my_unique_key (name, email));`

mysql> `describe employee;`



# Primary key
- Is used to identify each record in a table `uniquely`
- A table with a primary key cannot be null or empty
- Primary key column can also use the AUTO_INCREMENT attribute to generate a sequential number for the row automatically
- MySQL automatically create an index for the primary column

Rules
-----
1. Primary keycolumn value must be unique
2. Each table can contain only one primary key
3. The primary key column cannot be null
4. MySQL does not allow us to insert a new row with an existing primary key
5. It is recommended to use int as a data type for the primary key column

> create table employee (id integer primary key auto_increment, name char(50))


# Forign key
It is used to link one ore more then one table together
It is also know as referencing key
Foreign key matches the primary key of another table because the foreign key field in one table refer to the primary field of the other table
It is very important to maintain referential integrity in database

A foreign key make it possible to create a parent child relationship with the table

order
- orderId
- data
- amount
- custId

customer
- custId
- name
- email
- phone


# Example
 Customer
 - id
 - name
 - email



Address
 - addressId
 - house_number
 - city
 - country
 - cust_id



mysql> `describe customer; describe address;`



mysql> `alter table address add FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) REFERENCES customer(cust_id);`



mysql> `describe customer; describe address;`


mysql> `insert into customer (name, email) values ('a', 'a@gmail.com');`


mysql> `insert into customer (name, email) values ('b', 'b@gmail.com');`


mysql> `select * from customer;`


mysql>  `describe address;`


mysql>
mysql> `insert into address (city, country, cust_id) values ('NY', 'USA', 1);`

### JDBC
- `J`ava `D`atabase `C`onnctivity
- `JDBC is an Java API` to connect and execute the query with the database and is a part of Java SE.

- `JDBC API uses JDBC driver` to connect with the database

### There are different type of JDBC drivers
1. JDBC-ODBC driver
2. Native driver
3. Network Protocol driver
4. Thin driver


### A list of popular interfaces
- Driver interface
- Connection interface
- Statement Interface
- PrepareStatement interface
- ResultSet interfaces

and classes
- DriverManager
- Types Class

# Why should use JDBC
1. Connect to the database
2. Execute queries and update statement to the database
3. Retrieve the result received from the database


# Java database with 5 simple steps
1. register deriver
2. get connection
3. create statement
4. execute query
5. close connection

# Step1: register driver
The `forName()` method of a class which is used to register the driver class
This method is used to dynamically load the driver

class.forName('oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver');

# Step2: create connection
`getConnection()` method of DriverManager class which is used to establish connection with the database

public static Connection getConnection(String url, String username, String password);

# Step3: create the statement object

`createStatement()` method of connection interface is used to create a statement
the object of the statement is responsible to execute queries with the database

`public Statement createStatement()`


# Step4 : execute queries
`executeQuery()` method of statement interface is used to execute queries in the database
this method return the object of ResultSet that can be used to get all records of a table

`public ResultSet executeQuery(String sql)`

# Step5: close the connection

close() method


# MySQL Indexes
- An index is a data structure that allows us to add indexes in the existing table
- It enables you to improve the performance of your quaries
- It improve the faster retrieval of records on a database table
- It create an entry for each value of the indexed columns and we use it quickly to find a record without searching
  each and every row in the table
- we can create an index by using one or more colum

Example
- Employee
	Id
	Name
	Email
	Age


### How to create an index
Syntax
------
> `create index <index_name> on <table_name> (column <column_name>);`

### create
> `create index ix_name on employee(name);`

### drop
> `drop index <index_name> on <table_name>`

### show indexes
To get the index information of a table using show indexes statement

> `show indexes from <table_name>`
> `show indexes from table_name in database_name`.table_name
> `show keys from table_name in database_name`

# Show index query returns following information
- Table - 
    - table name
- Non_Unique: 
    - This returns 1 if the index contain duplicate value else it return 0
- Key_name: 
    - This is the name of the index, if the table contain primary key, the index name is always PRIMARY
- Seq_in_index: 
    - This is the sequence number of the column in the index that starts from 1
- Column_name: 
    - Contains the name of the column
- Collation: it gives information about the column is stored in the index
	A - ascending
	D - descending
	Null - not sorted
- Cardinality: it gives as estimated number of unique value in the index table where higher cardinality represent
	 a greater chance of using indexes
- Sub_part: it is a prefix of the index, it is NULL value if all the column of the table is indexed, it will return the number
            of indexes characters, when colum are partially indexed
- Null - it contain blank of the column does not have null value, otherwise it return true
- index_type: it contain the name of the index method like BTREE, HASH, FULLTEXT etc
- comment: it contain in index info whern they are not described
- visible: it contain yes if the index is visible to query optimizer otherwise no
- expression -  it contain some expression


# Type of indexes
- unique index
- clustered index
- non clustered index

# Unique index
- Find an unordered list into an ordered list that allows for quick retrieval of the records
it create an entry for each value that appears in the index column

we use primary key constraint to enforce the unique value in a column
but we can use only one primary key for each table
so if we want to make multiple sets of column with unique value then the primary key constraint will not be use

MySQL allow another constraint called unique index to enforce the uniqueness of the value in one or more column

we can create more then one unique index in a single table which is not possible with the primary key constraint

syntax
-------
create unique index <index_name> on <table_name>(col1, col2)

mysql allow us another approach to enforce unique value in ore or more column by using UNIQUE KEY

if we use UNIQUE constraint in the table MySQL automatically create a unique index behind the scene

syntax
------
`create table <table_name>(col, col2) constraint <col_name> UNIQUE KEY (col_name);`

Random side Note - 
` MySQL essentially implements the semantics defined by MATCH SIMPLE, which permits a foreign key to be all or partially NULL. In that case, a (child table) row containing such a foreign key can be inserted even though it does not match any row in the referenced (parent) table. (It is possible to implement other semantics using triggers.)`
